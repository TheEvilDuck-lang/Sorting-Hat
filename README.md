# Sorting-Hat
The Sorting Hat is a tradition in Hogwarts. Every year, it sorts first years into their Hogwarts house. In Hogwarts, your house is like your family. Gryffindor is for brave people, Hufflepuff is for hard-working and loyal people, Ravenclaw is for smart people, and Slytherin is for ambitious people. This program replicates the process of sorting an individual into their house.
